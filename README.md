## Installation

### Manual

## Customizing labels

You may want to set the labels of your sensors to something like 'CPU' instead of 'temp1'. Every motherboard is different so you will need to set these labels manually. See the ArchLinux [lm_sensors renaming labels](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lm_sensors#Example_2._Renaming_Labels) page for help with this.
